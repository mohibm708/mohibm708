# Hi.

My name's Mohib, and this is my GitHub profile. Sometime this year I'll figure out how to use this.

## Known Languages

I haven't *totally* understood the way these programming languages work, but every master was a learner, right?

* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* Markdown
* Swift (unfamiliar)
* Shellscript (*very* unfamiliar)

## Socials

I don't really use social media outside of, like, iMessage and my school email. I've got a website on Coder Merlin, though. [Check it out](https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mohibullah-meer/Digital%20Portfolio/index.html)!
